# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview: Include overview here

    The application is a project idea documentation... application that allows the user to draw out ideas on individual canvases, while also
        allowing them to pin reference photos on the side and keep notes in a notepad. Each canvas/reference photos/nodepad collection
        is saved separately in a larger grid system, allowing for organization. It's meant to be a convenient way for users to keep
        all of their ideas for any prospective craft (or otherwise) project in one spot for easy visual reference. Pinterest but a tool.

### Features: Include Features here

Visual Grid Homepage Thing
-Individual thumbnails of the user's drawings will be saved on the homepage in a simplistic, easy-to-navigate grid. Clicking on one of the
    thumbnails in the grid will open its respective Interactive Canvas for the user to edit.

Interactive Canvases
-The main function of the website is individual, "self-contained" Interactive Canvases on which the user can sketch ideas for projects.
    The Interactive Canvases are "self-contained" in each thumbnail of the Visual Grid Homepage Thing.
    The Interactive Canvas will have basic drawing/erasing functionality, with brush size control and brush color options.

User Login
-Users will be able to log in to save their Visual Grid Homepage Thing of Interactive Canvases.

Reference Image Board: Extended functionality
-The user will get a side board to hold reference project photos. This will be secondary to the main drawing canvas.  

Text Reference Board
-The user will get a side board to hold reference project text. This will be secondary to the main drawing canvas.


### Technologies: Include Technologies here
    -Java
    -Spring Boot
    -HTML5?
    -Javascript
    -MySQL
    -Hibernate
    -Thymeleaf
    
### What I'll Have to Learn: Include what you will need to learn here
    The first problem I'm forseeing is saving the user's work in the canvases. Saving data like that seems tricky. I also have to
        learn how to add the canvases in the first place. (LiterallyCanvas API?)
